# Source code for Spencer Hill's Solar energy website
This repository houses the source code I use to generate [my solar energy
website](https://www.prismaticindia.in/).  I write the website
as a set of [Emacs org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) files, and then use
org's [publishing](http://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html)
capabilities to generate the HTML.

If you're just looking for the website itself, visit it
[here](https://www.prismaticindia/~shill/).

Otherwise, see the
[org](https://github.com/spencerahill/my-website/tree/master/org)
subdirectory for the org mode files used to generate the HTML.

It's likely that this won't work on your machine out of the
box...there are some configurations required that live in my `.emacs`
file on my local machine.

Please feel free to copy any part of this repo --- although make sure
to replace my website contents with your own!
